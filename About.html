			<p style="margin-left:22vw;margin-right: 22vw;text-align: center;font-size: 1.5vw;margin-bottom: 5vw;">I’ve studied the science of nutrition and learned how movement and lifestyle changes promote healing and balance — and I’ve applied what I’ve learned to improve my own health. I’ve also worked with women to explore individualized ways to heal themselves and balance their thyroid, adrenal, and gut health.</p>

				<h2>My Story</h2>
				<p>Imagine a world without birthday cake, cookies, brownies, ice cream, and candy—essentially, a world without sugar. I thought this was my future when I was 9 years old. It was 1986, and I'd just been diagnosed with type 1 diabetes.</p>
				<p>Although my initial reaction was dramatic, I soon learned that life with diabetes was manageable, enjoyable, and could even include some sugar. I worked with many talented and compassionate health professionals after my diagnosis, but it was a dietitian who made the greatest impact on my young life.</p>
				<p>Due to my diagnosis, my entire family learned to eat more healthfully. With my mom, I'd experiment with different foods in the kitchen and figure out how to make our traditional meals more healthful to benefit our entire family. I always have and always will love to eat good food.</p>
				<p>When I entered college, I knew I wanted a career that focused on serving others. I wanted to help and inspire people to live better just like the dietitian I'd met many years ago. Nutrition and dietetics just felt natural to me. I began my studies with a focus on diabetes management, but soon realized I enjoyed a broader range of nutrition topics, especially education and outreach.</p>
				<p>My career has focused on nutrition education and outreach for vulnerable communities. As a former dietitian for the WIC program and a nutrition educator in Philadelphia, my mission was to reach and teach underserved populations. Those clients need the help of health professionals the most. With limited access to healthful foods and health care systems, it was rewarding to see the impact my programs had on the health of an entire family.</p>
				<p>Today, as a retail dietitian, I work with a diverse customer population. Regardless of their backgrounds, my customers still need a health navigator to guide them to the best food choices. Customers are looking for answers whether it's for weight loss, food allergies, disease management, or healthful meal planning. As a supermarket dietitian, I'm able to provide clarity at the most critical moment—right in front of the grocery cart.</p>
